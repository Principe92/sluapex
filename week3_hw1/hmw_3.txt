For p = 128 and n = 320, speed up: 126.89 efficiency: 0.99


 Describe what happens to the speedups and efficiencies as p is increased and n is held fixed? speedups increases, but efficiencies drops
 Describe what happens when p is fixed and n is increased? speedups increases and efficiencies increases
